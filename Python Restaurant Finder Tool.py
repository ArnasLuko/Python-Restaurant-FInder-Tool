#For this project, I created a series of classes that would process information regarding restaurants,

#creating of a tool which finds the nearest and best restaurant. Below is the first class, which deals with locations. 
#It has a methods for finding and setting the co-ordinates of a location object as well as a method for finding the 
#Manhattan distance between two location objects.
